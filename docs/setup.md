# Setup instructions

This page instructs software engineers how to get started working with the Django codebase and PostgreSQL database for the "core" Seshat webapp. It assumes the engineer has access to a dumpfile of the Seshat "core" database.

## Azure cloud setup with Pulumi

How to run a full setup of the Seshat django app on Azure with Pulumi based on [this guide](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/clouds/azure/get-started/begin/).

- Assumes Python 3 already installed on local machine so you can use the venv.
- The region specified in the Pulumi code is "UKSouth".
- Also assumes that you have a Seshat database dump including all the spatial data already. The project [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hRJ6HvHWqSjS7bUCGdXuabc4kD0H7q3_?usp=sharing) has this.
- If the shape data tables are not yet populated in your copy of the Seshat core database and you have access to source data, populate one or more of them with the instructions in [spatialdb.md](spatialdb.md).
- **Note:** The setup is only partially automated with Pulumi currently. As you'll see below, subsequent steps are required to that involve SSH-ing into the created VM.

### Pre-requisites

1. [Install Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/clouds/azure/get-started/begin/). e.g. on Mac:
    - Install `brew` if you don't have it already, see [here](https://brew.sh/)
    - Install pulumi with brew
        ```
            brew install pulumi/tap/pulumi
        ```
2. Install the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

Use the configuration in `/pulumi` or set up from scratch:
```
    pulumi new azure-python
```

In `/pulumi` we:
- Chose sensible project name: `seshat-dev`
- Chose default stack name
- Chose `UKSouth` location
- Made custom edits to the config files for the Seshat app

### Setup

1. Ensure logged in and that the subscription you will use comes up in the list of subscriptions printed out, then set to that subscription:
    ```
        az login
        az account set --subscription "<subscription-id>"
    ```
2. Activate Pulumi venv and install relevant package
    ```
        cd pulumi
        source venv/bin/activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Set up a Pulumi stack
    ```
        pulumi stack init seshat
        pulumi stack select seshat
    ```
4. Configure Pulumi:
    ```
        pulumi config set --secret sshPublicKey "$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)"
    ```
    - TODO: `privateKey` and `dumpFile` paths are needed for SCP command, which currently isn't working via Pulumi, see manual steps below
        <!-- ```
            pulumi config set privateKey "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
            pulumi config set dumpFile "/path/to/dumpfile.dump"
        ``` -->
5. Deploy the app
    ```
        pulumi up
    ```
6. Upload db dump with SCP:
    ```
        scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa /path/to/dumpfile.dump webadmin@<VM IP adress>:~/seshat.dump
    ```
7. SSH into the deployed VM and set up the database. *Note: we may eventually move the below manual steps to be part of the Pulumi automatedsetup*
    ```
        ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa webadmin@<VM IP adress>
    ```
    - Create db: open psql with `sudo -u postgres psql` and run:
        ```
            CREATE DATABASE <seshat_db_name>;
        ```
    - Add PostGIS to db: open psql with `sudo -u postgres psql -d <seshat_db_name>` and run:
        ```
            CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
        ```
    - Choose a password for Postgres. At Turing we have an Azure Key Vault set up under the project subscription where this can be saved (the one we have set up can be reused).
    - <details><summary>Add the password</summary>

        - Add a password for the superuser with `sudo -u postgres psql`:
            ```
                ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD '<db_password>';
            ```
        - Update postgres to use md5 with `sudo nano /etc/postgresql/16/main/pg_hba.conf`
            ![](img/pg_hba.conf.png)
        - Reload postgres
            ```
                sudo systemctl reload postgresql
            ```
        </details>
    - Restore the db from dump:
        ```
            sudo psql -U postgres <seshat_db_name> < ~/seshat.dump
        ```
    - Within the `seshat` repo, create a file called `seshat/settings/.env` with the db connection vars
        - For example:
            ```
                NAME=<seshat_db_name>
                USER=postgres
                HOST=localhost
                PORT=5432
                PASSWORD=<db_password>
            ```
8. Run django
    - Open `seshat/settings/local.py` and add the created IP address to `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
    - Configure and run
        ```
            sudo ufw allow 8000
            cd seshat
            source venv/bin/activate
            export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=seshat.settings.local
            gunicorn seshat.wsgi:application --config gunicorn.conf.py
        ```
    - Go to `http://<public IP>:8000/`

## Local setup

Local setup steps have been tested on an M1 Mac and on an Ubuntu VM running on the Mac.

<details><summary>Example Ubuntu VM setup on Mac</summary>

1. A quick way is to use multipass which can be installed with brew:
    - Install `brew` if you don't have it already, see [here](https://brew.sh/)
    - Install multipass with brew
        ```
            brew install multipass
        ```
    - Note: the images used by Multipass donâ€™t have a pre-installed graphical desktop
2. Create a VM (Ubuntu 22.04)
    ```
        multipass launch 22.04
    ```
    - This should create a VM called `primary` by default
3. Make sure the VM has enough resources:
    ```
        multipass stop primary
        multipass set local.primary.cpus=4
        multipass set local.primary.disk=60G
        multipass set local.primary.memory=8G
        multipass start primary
    ```
4. Mount the dir containing the database dump to the VM:
    ```
        multipass mount /path/to/database_dumps/ primary:database_dumps
    ```
5. Then log in to the VM with `multipass shell` and install pre-requisites:
    ```
        sudo apt update
        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
        sudo apt install python3.8 -y
        sudo apt install python3.8-venv -y
        sudo apt-get install python3.8-dev -y
        sudo apt-get install g++ -y
    ```

</details>

### Local Setup Steps

1. Ensure you have a working installation of Python 3

2. Set up a virtual environment for the project using e.g. venv or conda
    - Note: The application has been tested with Python **3.8.13**
    - Conda example:
        ```
            conda create --name seshat python=3.8.13
            conda activate seshat
        ```
    - venv example:
        ```
            python3.8 -m venv seshat
            source seshat/bin/activate
        ```

3. Either create a fork of the GitHub repo with all branches: https://github.com/MajidBenam/seshat or use https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/seshat for spatial dev work

4. Clone the repo e.g.
    ```
        git clone https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/seshat
    ```

5. Install PostgreSQL/PostGIS and create empty database

    - <details><summary>macOS</summary>

        - Installation: follow the instructions to install https://postgresapp.com/ which **gives you PostgreSQL version 16 with PostGIS installed**
        - Create db: open psql with `psql postgres` and run:
            ```
                CREATE DATABASE <seshat_db_name>;
            ```
        - Add extension: open psql with `psql postgres -d <seshat_db_name>` and run:
            ```
                CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
            ```
        </details>

    - <details><summary>Ubuntu</summary>

        - Installation
            ```
                sudo apt install gnupg2 wget vim -y

                sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'

                curl -fsSL https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/postgresql.gpg

                sudo apt update
                
                sudo apt install postgresql-16 postgresql-contrib-16 postgresql-16-postgis-3 -y
                
                sudo systemctl start postgresql

                sudo systemctl enable postgresql
            ```
        - Create db: open psql with `sudo -u postgres psql` and run:
            ```
                CREATE DATABASE <seshat_db_name>;
            ```
        - Add PostGIS to db: open psql with `sudo -u postgres psql -d <seshat_db_name>` and run:
            ```
                CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
            ```
        

        </details>


9. Install and configure GDAL and GEOS
    - <details><summary>Install instructions for macOS</summary>

        - Install `brew` if you don't have it already, see [here](https://brew.sh/)
        - Install `gdal` and `geos` with brew
            ```
                brew install gdal
                brew install geos
            ```
        </details>
    - <details><summary>Install instructions Ubuntu</summary>

        ```
            sudo apt-get install gdal-bin -y
            sudo apt-get install libgdal-dev -y
            sudo apt install libgeos++-dev libgeos3.10.2 -y
            sudo apt install libgeos-c1v5 libgeos-dev libgeos-doc -y
        ```
        - Note: you could first check the available libgeos version with: `sudo apt search libgeos`
        </details>
    - Open `seshat/settings/base.py` and check (or update) the paths in the following variables, which should be to your local `gdal` and `geos` installations
        - `GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH`
        - `GEOS_LIBRARY_PATH`
    - Note: there are hardcoded paths in base.py for the Mac and Ubuntu instructions above included

6. After PostgreSQL, GDAL and GEOS are installed, install the Python packages in your environment (some packages have these as dependencies). From the top level of the `seshat` repo:
    ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install "django-geojson [field]"
    ```

7. Restore Seshat database from dump file:

    - <details><summary>macOS</summary>

        ```
            psql <seshat_db_name> < /path/to/file.dump
        ```
        </details>
    - <details><summary>Ubuntu</summary>

        - `sudo nano /etc/postgresql/16/main/pg_hba.conf`
        - On the line `local all postgres peer` change "peer" to "trust"
        - Reload postgres and populate the db:
            ```
                sudo systemctl reload postgresql
                sudo psql -U postgres <seshat_db_name> < /path/to/file.dump
            ```
        </details>

8. Add a password to the db for security

    - <details><summary>macOS</summary>

        - Add a password for the superuser with `psql -U postgres`:
            ```
                ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD '<db_password>';
            ```
        - Locate `pg_hba.conf` if you don't know where it is
            ```
                psql -U postgres -c 'SHOW hba_file;'
            ```
        - Update postgres to use md5 with `nano /path/to/pg_hba.conf`
            ![](img/pg_hba.conf.png)
        </details>
    - <details><summary>Ubuntu</summary>

        - Add a password for the superuser with `sudo -u postgres psql`:
            ```
                ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD '<db_password>';
            ```
        - Update postgres to use md5 with `sudo nano /etc/postgresql/16/main/pg_hba.conf`
            ![](img/pg_hba.conf.png)
        - Reload postgres
            ```
                sudo systemctl reload postgresql
            ```
        </details>

8. Create a config with your database info for Django
    - Within the repo, create a file called `seshat/settings/.env` with the db connection vars
    - For example:
        ```
            NAME=<seshat_db_name>
            USER=postgres
            HOST=localhost
            PORT=5432
            PASSWORD=<db_password>
        ```
    - The presence of this file will ensure Django connects to your local database

9. Ensure that all Django database migrations have run:
    ```
        python manage.py migrate
    ```

10. If the shape data tables are not yet populated in your copy of the Seshat core database and you have access to source data, populate one or more of them with the instructions in [spatialdb.md](spatialdb.md).

11. Run Django
    - <details><summary>macOS</summary>

        ```
            python manage.py runserver
        ```

        The webapp should be visible in a browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
        </details>
    - <details><summary>Ubuntu VM set up with multipass on Mac</summary>

        - Check IP inside VM:
            ```
                ip addr show
            ```
            - e.g. `192.168.64.3`
        - In the VM, ensure the firewall doesn't block incoming connections on port 8000:
            ```
                sudo ufw allow 8000
            ```
        - In a mac terminal run:
            ```
                multipass exec primary -- sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8000 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.64.3:8000
            ```
            - Where `192.168.64.3` is the IP address
        - Restart the VM:
            ```
                multipass restart primary
            ```
        - Log back into the VM with `multipass shell` and run the django app:
            - Remember to firstactivate the venv e.g.
                ```
                    source seshat/bin/activate
                ```
            ```
                python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
            ```
            - Go to http://192.168.64.3:8000/ in a browser (where `192.168.64.3` is the IP address)
