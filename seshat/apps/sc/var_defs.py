 'communal_building': "This code distinguishes between settlements that consist of only private households (code 'absent') and settlements where there are communal buildings which could be used for a variety of uses (code 'present').",
 'utilitarian_public_building': 'Typical examples include aqueducts, sewers, and granaries. In the narrative paragraph list all utilitarian buildings and give examples of the most impressive/costly/large ones.',
 'symbolic_building': "Non-utilitarian constructions that display symbols, or are themselves symbols of the community or polity (or a ruler as a symbol of the polity). Examples include Taj Mahal mausoleum, Trajan's Column, Ashoka's Pillars, Qin Shih Huang's Terracota Army, the Statue of Liberty. Has to be constructed by humans, so sacred groves or mountains are not symbolic buildings. A palace is also not a symbolic building, because it has other, utilitarian functions (houses the ruler).",
 'entertainment_building': 'These include theaters, arenas, race tracks.',
 'knowledge_or_information_building': 'These include astronomic observatories, libraries, and museums.',
 'special_purpose_site': 'Sites not associated with residential areas. This position is primarily useful for coding archaneologically known societies.',
 'ceremonial_site': 'No Description',
 'burial_site': 'Dissociated from settlement, has monumental features.',
 'trading_emporia': 'Trading settlements characterised by their peripheral locations, on the shore at the edge of a polity, a lack of infrastructure (typically those in Europe contained no churches) and often of a short-lived nature. They include isolated caravanserai along trade routes.',
 'enclosure': "An 'enclosure' is clearly demarcated special-purpose area. It can be separated from surrounding land by earthworks (including banks or ditches), walls, or fencing. It may be as small as a few meters across, or encompass many hectares. It is non-residential, but could serve numerous purposes, both practical (animal pens) as well as religious and ceremonial",

 'area_measurement_system': 'Textual evidence of area measurement systems. Measurement units are named in sources.',

 'weight_measurement_system': 'Textual evidence of weight measurement systems. Measurement units are named in sources.',
 'time_measurement_system': "Textual evidence of time measurement systems. Measurement units are named in sources. A natural unit such as 'day' doesn't qualify. Nor does a vague one like 'season'. Archaeological evidence is a clock (e.g., sundial)",
