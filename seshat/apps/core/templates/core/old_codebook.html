<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Database_Architecture">Database Architecture</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket make-invisible">[</span><a class="make-invisible" href="/w/index.php?title=Code_book&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Database Architecture">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket make-invisible">]</span></span></h2>
<p>The basic components of the database architecture are <i>units</i>, <i>variables</i>, and spatio-temporal <i>coordinates</i>. Units serve as both methods of data entry and potential units of statistical analysis. They are characterized by spatio-temporal coordinates, which are dynamical (in other words, the spatial extent of a unit can change with time). Variables are coded through units, and therefore units are the means of tying values of coded variables to spatio-temporal coordinates.
</p><p>Currently we have the following types of units (this list may be expanded as needed):
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Natural Geographic Region (NGA)</b>. This type of unit is defined spatially by the area enclosed within a boundary drawn on the world map. It does not change with time. Its rough spatial scale is 100 km × 100 km (+/- 50%). Examples: Latium, Upper Egypt, Middle Yellow River Valley.</li>
<li> <b>Polity</b>. Polity is defined as an independent political unit. Kinds of polities range from villages (local communities) through simple and complex chiefdoms to states and empires. A polity can be either centralized or not (e.g., organized as a confederation). What distinguishes a polity from other human groupings and organizations is that it is politically independent of any overarching authority; it possesses sovereignty. Polities are defined spatially by the area enclosed within a boundary on the world map. There may be more than one such areas. Polities are dynamical entities, and thus their geographical extent may change with time. Thus, typically each polity will be defined by a set of multiple boundaries, each for a specified period of time. For prehistoric periods and for NGAs populated by a multitude of small-scale polities we use a variant called <b>quasi-polity</b> (see below)</li>
<li> <b>Quasi-polity</b>. The polity-based approach is not feasible for those periods when a NGA is divided up among a multitude of small-scale polities (e.g., independent villages or even many small chiefdoms) or when it is controlled in quick succession by a number of different regimes. In instances such as these we use the concept of 'quasi-polity' (in either its 'spatial' and/or 'temporal' sense). An example of a quasi-polity in its spatial sense is the Neo-Hittite Kingdoms, while a quasi-polity in its temporal form would be the 28th-30th Dynasties of Egypt. The idea is to collect data for the quasi-polity as a whole. This way we can integrate over (often patchy) data from different sites and different polities to estimate what a 'generic' polity was like. Accordingly, when coding, for example, social complexity variables, enter data not for the whole NGA but for a 'typical' polity in it. For example, when coding for a quasi-polity <b>polity territory</b> is not the area of the NGA as a whole, but the average or typical area of polities within the NGA. Similarly, for societies known only archaeologically we may not be able to establish the boundaries of polities, even approximately. <i>Quasi-polity</i> is defined as a cultural area with some degree of cultural (including linguistic, if known) homogeneity that is distinct from surrounding areas. For example, the Marshall Islands before German occupation had no overarching native or colonial authority (chiefs controlled various subsets of islands and atolls) and therefore it was not a polity. But it was a quasi-polity because of the significant cultural and linguistic uniformity.</li>
<li> <b>Religious System (RS)</b>. This unit is defined in ways that are analogous to a polity, except it reflects religious, rather than political authority. Religious systems are dynamical and are typically defined by a set of dated boundaries. Unlike polities, religious systems often overlap with each other.</li>
<li> <b>City</b>. Cities are represented by a single point on the map that doesn’t change with time. Although it is possible to reflect their spatial expansion dynamically, we chose not to do so in the current implementation.</li>
<li> <b>Interest Group (IG)</b>. An IG is a social group that pursues some common interest, so that its members are united by a common goal or goals. Polities and religious cults are also interest groups, but the IG category is broader. It also includes ethnic groups, professional associations, warrior bands, solidarity associations, mutual aid societies, firms and banks (including their premodern variants), etc. The IG is defined sociologically, not geographically. However, if desired, a geographic area, enclosed within a boundary, may be associated with it in the same way as with a polity or a RS.</li>
<li> <b>Freeform area (FA)</b>. This is an area enclosed within a boundary, or a dated set of boundaries. Basically, it is our method for treating an arbitrary shape on the map to which a historical expert wishes to tie certain values of coded variables. Examples include a province within an empire, something with a hole in it, or a ‘southeast corner of a region.’</li></ul>
<p><b>Notes:</b>
</p>
<ul><li> As the database evolves, and more questions are posed, it is conceivable that other units could be added.</li>
<li> We recognize that most historical polities did not have sharp boundaries. Instead, their sphere of control may gradually decline from the political center, or centers. There could be effectively stateless lacunae inside the territory nominally claimed by a state. The current implementation of the database does not reflect such ‘facts on the ground.’ However, we will consider implementing such a feature in a future version, so suggestions on how to do this are welcome.</li>
<li> As a coding convention, we prefer to limit the temporal extent of polities to two-three centuries, because polities tend to evolve with time and often experience transformative events, which make it more natural to code the next period as a different polity. For example, we divide Roman history into the following polities: Regal, Early, Middle, and Late Republic, Principate, and Dominate.</li>
<li> The current version of the Code Book has been developed primarily for historical societies. Coding data for societies that are known only archaeologically poses an additional set of challenges. We are currently developing a Seshat CodeBook-Archaeology that will address these challenges.</li></ul>

<p>(using approaches based on NGAs, as an example)
</p>
<ul><li> Identify an NGA within the larger UTM Zone. This should be an area ideally around 100 by 100 km, or 10,000 sq. km. Dimensions, of the NGA can, however, vary by 50% (and in rare cases, more).</li>
<li> In the NGA page list chronologically all polities that were located in the NGA, or encompassed in it (see <a class="make-invisible" href="/w/index.php?title=Latium" title="Latium">Latium</a> as an example). For periods when the NGA was fragmented among many small-scale polities, use the quasi-polity approach. In the intermediate case, when there are several (few) polities, focus on the one that controls the largest proportion of the NGA.</li>
<li> As a coding convention, we try not to have chunks of time that are too long on the same polity data sheet. Try to limit the length to 200-300 years, but at the same time don't slice it too thinly. Aim at roughly 200 (100-300) year chunks, but be guided by actual historical events that result in major change. As an example, we have split Rome-Republican Period into three, see the list of polities in <a class="make-invisible" href="/w/index.php?title=Latium" title="Latium">Latium</a>.</li>
<li> If coding polity-based variables, switch to a polity and code all variables on its page. In other words, you don't put any polity-related codes within the NGA sheet. The NGA is used purely as a sampling scheme, all codes go into the relevant polity sheets.</li>
<li> If coding resources, agriculture, and population, list chronologically the general 'epochs' and then code these variables for each period separately (again, see <a class="make-invisible" href="/w/index.php?title=Latium" title="Latium">Latium</a> NGA for an example).</li>
<li> Same approach is used to add lists of religious systems and cities, in which case entry is linked to the page where codes for the RS or city are located.</li></ul>

<ul><li> Every entry field consists of two different sections. The first is machine readable. It is indicated by boldface in the reading mode and by being enclosed between triple quotes in editing mode. All dates are entered after the colon in the machine readable part of the entry field. The card suit symbols delimit the variable name and coded value, like this:</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd class="ps-5"><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ 5,300,000 ♥</b> squared kilometers</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<ul><li> The second, narrative section follows the machine readable part. It is used to explain the reasoning behind the specific code selected, list references, indicate whether the data is based upon historical or archaeological sources, provide other information important to contextualize the dates and so on. In many ways this section is even more important than the code itself, because it allows the knowledge to accumulate. We expect that each coding sheet will be gone over by multiple historians, who will need to know why a particular code was chosen to decide whether they agree with it, or can improve on it by bringing in additional information. It is also possible that subsequent historians will register their dissenting opinions on how the variable should be coded, and there is a method for doing that (see below).</li></ul>

<ul><li> All dates are followed by either BCE or CE. bce stands for Before Common Era and ce indicates Common Era.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Generally speaking, the hyphen (-) indicates a range</li></ul>
<ul><li> To indicate the length of time a feature was present we use the hyphen (-), between the start date and the end date. Different dates or time periods are separated from each other by the semicolon (;). For example, suppose the territory of the polity to be coded was 5,300,000 sq km between 120 BCE and 75 BCE, but then an additional region was added, bringing the total territory to 6,100,000 sq km (and this territory was unchanged until 30 CE). We code it like this:</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd class="ps-5"><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ 5,300,000: 120-75 BCE; 6,100,000: 75-30 CE ♥</b> squared kilometers</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<ul><li> We use different types of brackets to indicate varying degrees of certainty (or confidence) with which the dates are entered into the database. As a ground rule no brackets means a high degree certainty and no disagreement between experts. Where we cannot pinpoint the precise value, we use square brackets, i.e. [ ]. Note that the square brackets cover what is known in statistics as the 90 percent confidence interval. In other words, we do not attempt to capture all remotely possible values, but only the more likely ones, leaving off 5 percent of probability out at each end. For example, suppose the population of the polity in 100 BCE was somewhere between 1.5 and 2 million. Then we code it like this:</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd class="ps-5"><b>♠ Polity population ♣ [1,500,000 - 2,000,000]: 100 BCE ♥</b></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>Again, remember not to cover all remotely possible contingencies; focus on the likely range.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Note that we code the uncertainty on the <b>values</b>, not on the dates. If for example the sources or experts are unclear about whether or not professional military officers appeared between 150 BCE and 90 BCE, then we code it like this:
<dl><dd><dl><dd class="ps-5"><b>♠ Professional military officers ♣ [absent; present]: 150-90 BCE♥</b> The date here is coded in a range, the uncertainty is coded in the value</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li> Curly brackets, { }, indicate disagreements between experts.  For example, if two different experts disagreed on the population of the polity in 100 BCE then we code it like this:</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd class="ps-5"><b>♠ Polity population ♣ {1,500,000; 2,000,000}: 100 BCE ♥</b></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Expert disagreements are handled similarly as uncertainty -- the disagreement is recorded on the value, <b>not</b> on the date. If according to one expert professional military officers appeared in 150 BCE, while another thinks that it only happened in 90 BCE. We code it like this:</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd class="ps-5"><b>♠ Professional military officers ♣ absent: 500-150 BCE; {absent; present}: 150-90 BCE; present: 90 BCE - 1 CE ♥</b></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Policy_on_Coding_inferred_present_and_inferred_absent_and_the_uncertainty_when_a_trait_appears">Policy on Coding inferred present and inferred absent and the uncertainty when a trait appears</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket make-invisible">[</span><a class="make-invisible" href="/w/index.php?title=Code_book&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Policy on Coding inferred present and inferred absent and the uncertainty when a trait appears">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket make-invisible">]</span></span></h3>
<p>As a coding convention, use the 'inferred absent' and 'inferred present' codes to code a specific variable when the available literature does not provide unequivocal evidence of presence/absence for that trait, yet there is reason to infer or deduce that the trait was or was not present in the society.
</p><p>The inferred present code should be used when other evidence implies or requires the existence of some trait in the polity. For instance, if it is known that goods were transported overland along routes which crossed large river-ways and that wood was the primary construction material in the polity, it may be reasonable to infer the presence of bridges in the Transport Infrastructure section even if bridges are not specifically mentioned in the sources (as this could be due to the perishability of the building material).
</p><p>The inferred absence code should be used wherever it seems likely that a trait is not mentioned in the available literature because the trait was indeed absent from the polity, rather than simply being unavailable to modern scholars for lack of surviving evidence. For instance, in the Kinds of Written Documents section, if the polity has numerous written records that survive and there is no mention in any source of any works of fiction known from the polity, then it is appropriate to code inferred absence for the Fiction variable.
</p><p>Coders should let logic guide their decisions. <b>It is crucial that all inferred absent /inferred present codes be followed by a detailed explanation in the descriptive section clarifying the nature of and reason for the inference.</b>
</p><p>Inferences can be made both forwards and backwards in time. Drawing inferences backwards, for example for the polity before we know for certain a legal code was present, might often result in a code of "inferred absent". Another common situation is when a trait is present at, for example, 1000 CE and 1400 CE. It can be inferred present also for 1200 and 1300 CE, even if there is no direct evidence of its presence (and there is no evidence that it was first lost, than regained). Similarly, if we know that iron metallurgy was practiced by most or all societies in the general vicinity of the coded one, we can infer presence. Remember that the device of square brackets [absent; present] can also be used (see next paragraph).
</p><p>Note that when we code [absent; present] this code is not simply "unknown". We use it when there is uncertainty about whether a trait appeared during a particular time period, or for the entire polity duration. See above for explanations of how to use square brackets [] to express uncertainty. Conversely, when we code "suspected unknown", this does not mean uncertainty, it means that the coder has made a study of the variable and cannot find relevant information or there are gaps in the records that do not permit any other code, including inference. A code of "unknown" is assigned when a relevant domain expert confirms that this variable cannot be coded because of gaps in the direct and indirect historical or archaeological record. <i><b>Importantly, only an expert can suggest a code of 'unknown'; RAs should use only 'suspected unknown'.</b></i>
</p><p>If there is good evidence that something was absent and then became present at a point in time, but not clear when it first appeared (or the opposite - was present and became absent or obsolete), use the conventions on coding transitions (explained below).

<ul><li> Some traits are known to either appear or disappear within a certain time period, but it is unknown precisely when this transition occurs. These are coded as follows:
<ul><li><b>absent_to_present</b> = it is unclear from the evidence precisely when the variable appears but there is direct evidence of its absence until some point and there is direct evidence of its presence from some later point. The intervening period between the codes absent and present is coded [absent; present]. For example, ♠ Professional military officers ♣ absent: 500-150 BCE; absent_to_present: 150-90 BCE; present: 90 BCE - 1 CE ♥</li>
<li><b>present_to_absent</b> = it is unclear from the evidence precisely when the variable disappears but there is direct evidence of its presence until some point and there is direct evidence of its absence from some later point. This is the inverse of the situation described for the code absent_to_present. It is also used when a trait becomes obsolete. For example, crossbow becomes obsolete when firearms become sufficiently effective, so it should be coded present_to_absent if this transition occurs at an unknown time</li></ul></li></ul>
<dl><dd>note that when the precise date of a transition is known, this is simply reflected in dated simple codes, for example: ♠ Professional military officers ♣ absent: 500-1103 BCE; present: 103 BCE - 1 CE ♥</dd></dl>

<ul><li> In summary, the conventions of using various punctuation signs as follows:
<ul><li> Hyphen indicates a range</li>
<li> Colon divides the value from time period</li>
<li> Semicolon is used within square [] or curly {} brackets to separate the extreme values. It is also used to demarcate different sections of code, like here to separate out the codes for the periods 120-75 BCE and 75 BCE - 30 CE: <b>♠ Polity territory ♣ 5,300,000: 120-75 BCE; 6,100,000: 75 BCE - 30 CE ♥</b> squared kilometers</li>
<li> Comma is reserved for the 'thousands separator' (so 1 million = 1,000,000) and dot as the decimal mark (so pi = 3.14). Don't mix up the use of commas and semicolons within square and curly brackets, as that would confuse the webcrawler program that will harvest data from the Wiki-database</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>The following most widely used binary codes are defined as follows:
</p>
<ul><li> 'absent' = evidence of absence</li>
<li> 'present' = evidence of presence</li>
<li> 'inferred absent' = evidence implying absence. See the explanation above.</li>
<li> 'inferred present' = evidence implying presence. See above.</li>
<li>'[absent; present]' and '[present; absent]' = uncertainty about appearance of a trait (different than scholarly disagreement). See above for details.</li>
<li> 'absent_to_present' = transition that is not able to be dated precisely. See above for details.</li>
<li> 'present_to_absent' = transition that is not able to be dated precisely. See above for details.</li>
<li> '{present; absent}' = Two or more experts are in disagreement over the coding status of this variable. (Curly brackets indicate this type of uncertainty concerns expert opinion).</li>
<li> 'unknown' = an expert has made a study of this variable and believes that this variable cannot be coded because of gaps in the direct and indirect (when available) historical or archaeological record. If another expert disagrees with the original expert's assessment the code should be changed to reflect expert uncertainty.</li>
<li> ‘suspected unknown' = the RA suspects that the variable should be coded ‘unknown’ because of gaps in the primary and secondary (when available) historical or archaeological record but an expert is needed to confirm this.</li>
<li> 'not applicable' = the coder has attempted to assign a code to a variable (e.g., present/absent), but determined that it cannot be coded because no alternative code is appropriate. For example, a variable pertaining to specific mechanisms for constraining the power of an executive would receive the code 'not applicable' if no executive was present to be constrained.</li>
<li> blank = no coder has engaged with this variable or more work needs to be done to provide a code for this variable</li></ul>

<p>The next three coding positions define the temporal bounds of the polity. These codes take into account that such temporal bounds may be fuzzy and allow us to capture this 'fuzziness.' For example, some polities such as the Medieval German Empire or China under the Zhou Dynasty began as reasonably coherent states, but with time gradually lost cohesion, the degree to which the center exercized control over regional subpolities. Because this process was gradual, there was no sharp temporal boundary. The 'Degree of centralization' variable allows to capture these transitions (by coding time periods when the polity transitions, for example, from a 'confederated state' to 'loose' and finally to 'nominal' degree of centralization. Similarly, polities may have a fuzzy starting date, if they originate as subpolities under a disintegrating overarching polity. These transitions are captured by the variable 'Supra-polity relations'.
</p><p><b> ♠ Duration  ♣ ♥ </b> The starting and ending dates covered by this coding sheet. Briefly explain the significance of each date. For example, the starting date could be the establishment of a long-ruling dynasty, while the ending date may be the year when the polity was conquered by an aggressive neighbor. In cases when starting and/or ending dates are fuzzy, as explained above, use the earliest possible starting date and the latest possible ending date. This approach will result in a temporal overlap, so that some NGAs for some periods will be coded as belonging to two polities simultaneously (e.g., to a disintegrating overarching polity and to the rising regional subpolity). Such overlap is acceptable, and will  be dealt with at the analysis stage.
</p><p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ ♥ </b> unknown/ quasi-polity/ nominal/ loose/ confederated state /unitary state
</p>
<ul><li>'quasi-polity' = or 'none'. Use if, for example, the NGA is inhabited by many politically independent groups. There are four types of quasi-polity: archaeological, temporal, complex and dominant. <a class="make-invisible" href="/w/index.php?title=Quasi-Polities&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Quasi-Polities (page does not exist)">Quasi-Polities</a>: further information.</li>
<li>'nominal' = regional rulers pay only nominal allegiance to the overall ruler and maintain independence on all important aspects of governing, including taxation and warfare. (example: Japan during the Sengoku period)</li>
<li>'loose' = the central government exercises a certain degree of control, especially over military matters and international relations. Otherwise the regional rulers are left alone (example: European 'feudalism' after the collapse of the Carolingian empire)</li>
<li>'confederated state' = regions enjoy a large degree of autonomy in internal (regional) government. In particular, the regional governors are either hereditary rulers, or are elected by regional elites or by the population of the region; and regional governments can levy and dispose of regional taxes. Use this category for the more centralized 'feudal states'.</li>
<li>'unitary state' = regional governors are appointed and removed by the central authorities, taxes are imposed by, and transmitted to the center</li></ul>
<p><b> ♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ ♥ </b> unknown/ none/ alliance/ nominal allegiance/ personal union/ vassalage/
</p>
<ul><li>'alliance' = belongs to a long-term military-political alliance of independent polities ('long-term' refers to more or less permanent relationship between polities extending over multiple years)</li>
<li>'nominal allegiance' = same as 'nominal' under the variable "Degree of centralization" but now reflecting the position of the focal polity within the overarching political authority</li>
<li>'personal union' = the focal polity is united with another, or others, as a result of a dynastic marriage</li>
<li>'vassalage' = corresponding to 'loose' category in the Degree of centralization</li></ul>

<p>Below code cultural relations between the coded (quasi)polity and the preceding one, as well as those nearby. These codes are particularly useful for archaeologically known polities.
</p>
<dl><dd class="ps-5"><b> ♠ preceding (quasi)polity  ♣  ♥ </b> Name. This code is based on the core region of the current polity (not the NGA region). E.g. Achaemenid Empire's core region was Persia, where they were preceded by the Median Empire.</dd>
<dd class="ps-5"><b> ♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣  ♥ </b> Possible codes: continuity (gradual change), cultural assimilation (by another quasi-polity in the absence of substantial population replacement), elite migration (the preceding elites replaced by new elites coming from elsewhere), population migration (evidence for substantial population replacement), secession (from another polity). In the narrative paragraph explain the evidential basis for the code: what are the proxies for change? Examples include DNA data, isotope data, material (other than subsistence) culture, subsistence mode, symbolic culture (incl. burial practices), settlement patterns.</dd>
<dd class="ps-5"><b> ♠ succeeding (quasi)polity  ♣  ♥ </b> Name. Only name it here and don't code the nature of change (it's coded on the page of the succeeding quasi-polity). This code is based on the core region of the current polity (not the NGA region). E.g. Achaemenid Empire's core region was Persia, where they were succeeded by the Macedonian Empire.</dd>
<dd class="ps-5"><b> ♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥ </b> Name it. Our quasi-polity are often embedded within larger-scale cultural groupings of polities or quasi-polities. These are sometimes referred to as "civilizations". For example, medieval European kingdoms were part of Latin Christendom. During the periods of disunity in China, warring states there, nevertheless, belonged to the same Chinese cultural sphere. Archaeologists often use "archaeological traditions" to denote such large-scale cultural entities (for example, Peregrine's Atlas of Cultural Evolution). Note, 'supracultural entity' refers to cultural interdependence, and is distinct from a political confederation or alliance, which should be coded under 'supra-polity relations.'</dd></dl>
<p>In the narrative paragraph details the types of supracultural links between the coded polity and the supracultural entity: trade, religion, ritual, demographic (e.g., migration, colonization), artistic/symbolic, technological, spousal/marriage (especially between the elites)
</p>
<dl><dd class="ps-5"><b> ♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥ </b>km squared. An estimate of the area encompassed by the supracultural entity</dd></dl>
<p><b> ♠ Capital  ♣ ♥ </b> The city where the ruler spends most of its time. If there were more than one capital supply all names and enclose in curly braces. For example, {Susa; Pasargadae; Persepolis; Ecbatana; Babylon}. Note that the capital may be different from the largest city (see below).
</p><p>'Capital' may be difficult to code for archaeologically known societies. If there is reasonable basis to believe that the largest known settlement was the seat of the ruler code it as capital (and indicate uncertainty in the narrative paragraph). Archaeologists are able to recognize special architectural structures, such as a ceremonial centres and some kind of citadels or palaces. These features could be recognized with certainty after a careful study of the whole region and the settlement network. If such an inference cannot be made, code as 'unknown' (again, the largest settlement is coded elsewhere).
</p><p><b>Language</b> List the language(s) used polity-wide for administration, religion, and military affairs. Also list the language spoken by the majority of the population, if different from the above.

<dd> <b> ♠ Linguistic Family ♣ ♥ </b></dd>
<dd> <b> ♠ Language Genus ♣ ♥ </b></dd></dl>
<p><br>
<b>Religion</b> List the religion(s) practiced by the ruling elites in the polity. Also list religion traditions practiced by non-elites, as well as other notable religions practiced by members of the polity. List up to 3 religious traditions. If there are other religious traditions, either practiced only for a short time during the polity's duration (e.g. one ruler in a dynasty initiates a novel religion) or practiced by only a small minority of the population, describe those traditions in the descriptive paragraph. The names of the religious traditions should be adapted, where possible, from the <i>Database of Religious History</i> project, accessible here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://religiondatabase.org/about/tree/">https://religiondatabase.org/about/tree/</a>.

<p><b> ♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ ♥ </b> levels.  This variable records the hierarchy of not just settlement sizes, but also their complexity as reflected in different roles they play within the (quasi)polity. As settlements become more populous they acquire more complex functions: transportational (e.g. port); economic (e.g. market); administrative (e.g. storehouse, local government building); cultural (e.g. theatre); religious (e.g. temple), utilitarian (e.g. hospital), monumental (e.g. statues, plazas).
</p><p>Example: (1) Large City (monumental structures, theatre, market, hospital, central government buildings) (2) City (market, theatre, regional government buildings) (3) Large Town (market, administrative buildings) (4) Town (administrative buildings, storehouse)) (5) Village (shrine) (6) Hamlet (residential only).
</p><p>In the narrative paragraph explain the different levels and list their functions. Provide a (crude) estimate of population sizes. For example, Large Town (market, temple, administrative buildings): 2,000-5,000 inhabitants.
</p><p><b> ♠ Administrative levels ♣ ♥ </b> levels. An example of hierarchy for a state society could be (1) the overall ruler, (2) provincial/regional governors, (3) district heads, (4) town mayors, (5) village heads. Note that unlike in settlement hierarchy, here you code people hierarchy.
<b>Do not simply copy settlement hierarchy data here.</b> For archaeological polities, you will usually code as 'unknown', unless experts identified ranks of chiefs or officials independently of the settlement hierarchy.
</p><p>Note: Often there are more than one concurrent administrative hierarchy. In the example above the hierarchy refers to the territorial government. In addition, the ruler may have a hierarchically organized central bureaucracy located in the capital. For example, (4)the overall ruler, (3) chiefs of various ministries, (2) mid-level bureaucrats, (1) scribes and clerks. In the narrative paragraph detail what is known about both hierarchies. The machine-readable code should reflect the largest number (the longer chain of command).
</p><p><b> ♠ Religious levels ♣ ♥ </b> levels. Same principle as with the previous variable. Start with the head of the official cult (if present) = level 1 and work down to the local priest.
</p><p><b> ♠ Military levels ♣ ♥ </b> levels. Again, start with the commander-in-chief = level 1 and work down to the private.
</p><p>Even in primitive societies such as simple chiefdoms it is often possible to distinguish at least two levels – a commander and soldiers. A complex chiefdom would be coded three levels. The presence of warrior burials might be the basis for inferring the existence of a military organization. (The lowest military level is always the individual soldier).

Code this absent if administrative duties are performed by generalists such as chiefs and subchiefs. Also code it absent if state officials perform multiple functions, e.g. combining administrative tasks with military duties. Note that this variable shouldn't be coded "present" only on the basis of the presence of specialized government buildings -- there must be some additional evidence of functional specialization in government.
</p><p><b> ♠ Source of support ♣ ♥ </b> possible codes: state salary, governed population, land, none. 'State salary' can be paid either in currency or in kind (e.g., koku of rice). 'Governed population' means that the official directly collects tribute from the population (for example, the 'kormlenie' system in Medieval Russia). 'Land' is when the bureaucrats live off land supplied by the state. 'None' is when the state officials are not compensated (example: in the Republican and Principate Rome the magistrates were wealthy individuals who served without salary, motivated by prestige and social or career advancement).
</p><p><b> ♠ Examination system ♣ ♥ </b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown. The paradigmatic example is the Chinese imperial system.
</p><p><b> ♠ Merit promotion ♣ ♥ </b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown Code present if there are regular, institutionalized procedures for promotion based on performance. When exceptional individuals are promoted to the top ranks, in the absence of institutionalized procedures, we code it under institution and equity variables
</p><p><b> ♠ Specialized government buildings ♣ ♥ </b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown. These buildings are where administrative officials are located, and must be distinct from the ruler's palace. They may be used for document storage, registration offices, minting money, etc. Defense structures also are not coded here (see Military).

Provide an estimate in km of the extent of the longest of such fortification systems. If not present, enter '0'. Very large circular walls protecting a settlement are not long walls - long walls are fairly linear and protect whole areas from incursions. If a polity inherits a stone wall from a previous one and continues to use and repair it, then we should probably code it as present.</dd>

<p><b> ♠ Standing armies ♣  ♥ </b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown. Permanent armed forces that may be scaled back between conflicts, but not completely disbanded
</p><p><b> ♠ Uniformity of equipment ♣  ♥ </b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown. The state equips the troops with standardized equipment. The alternative is for soldiers themselves to provide their own equipment
</p><p><b> ♠ Total army ♣  ♥ </b>  potential total manpower resources that can be called upon by the polity as an effective army. These troops do not all need to be professional but they should undergo either occasional training and/or have access to military weapons. This figure should include an estimate for the number of foreign mercenaries that could be hired on an ad hoc basis. This army doesn’t need to be gathered in one location (for example, troops could be sent to, or stationed on several distant frontiers).
</p><p><b> ♠ Professional army ♣  ♥ </b> size of the army that is remunerated when not on active duty (via salary or with land such as with the provision of an iqta or fief) and so can be called upon to fight at any time.

</p><p><b> ♠ Maximum logistical lag ♣  ♥ </b> The longest time it takes (in days) to move an army from the capital city to any provincial capital (if one exists), via movements usually within the boundaries of the polity. This variable differs from the "fastest individual communication" variable in two ways: 1) the most distant provincial capital in space (km) is not always the most distant in time (days); 2) moving an army is much harder than a single individual so the value can be different due to logistical factors. Seasons (weather) may affect travel time so in some circumstances it may be appropriate to code a range of values, between summer and winter.
</p><p><b> ♠ Sources of recruits ♣  ♥ </b> Regular draft, mercenaries, mass mobilization, recruits into a professional corps: domestic or foreign. Could all segments of the population serve in the army, or was it restricted to such groups as elites, certain ethnicities or regions, foreigners, etc.
</p><p><b> ♠ Procurement of equipment and animals ♣  ♥ </b> Possible codes:

<p>This section provides general information on the types of wars (if any) that affected the coded (quasi)polity. The coding strategy here is binary (absent/present). These codes will be supplemented, where possible, by quantitative data from coding each known war along the same dimensions. However, for poorly known historical periods and for polities for which only archaeological data are available, such quantitative data are unavailable, and this section's purpose is to provide less precise data that could still be used in the analysis.
</p><p>Explain the codes. After coding 'present' provide an example of a war that had the coded characteristic.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Types_of_Warfare">Types of Warfare</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket make-invisible">[</span><a class="make-invisible" href="/w/index.php?title=Code_book&amp;action=edit&amp;section=48" title="Edit section: Types of Warfare">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket make-invisible">]</span></span></h4>
<p><b>♠ Inter-polity wars ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown Code present, if at least one war during this period was an external (interstate) war. Provide an example.
</p><p><b>♠ Internal wars ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown Code present, if at least one war during this period was an internal (within polity) war. When the belligerents are sub-units of a Seshat-defined quasi-polity that has never previously been centralized (e.g. an archaeological tradition) this is always coded as an inter-polity war not internal warfare. Internal wars occur when sub-units under centralized authority start fighting. This state of warfare remains internal warfare even once the central authority has receded to a nominal status (such periods may be coded as a quasi-polity). Inter-polity warfare occurs when central authority is not present or was previously present but has now been formally revoked.
</p><p>The next variables provide additional description of internal wars. Because civil wars often involve several dimensions, code 'Present' as many of the following variables as apply.
</p><p><b>♠ Intra-elite conflicts ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown Between different elite factions. E.g. the Angkor Civil War of 1181 CE, in which Jayavarman VII fought with cousins and other aspirants for the throne
</p><p><b>♠ Popular uprisings ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown A broadly based rebellion in which commoners (non-elites) are the major component. It can take place in the central regions of the polity, or in peripheral regions (in which case a separatist rebellion can also be coded as present), or both. E.g. the Yellow Turban Rebellion of 184 CE against Eastern Han Dynasty rule
</p><p><b>♠ Military revolts ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown Insurrection lead by a military leader involving components of armed forces. E.g. the Abbasid Revolution against Umayyad authority
</p><p><b>♠ Separatist rebellions ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown Rebellion in a region aiming to secede from the center. E.g. the Seven Kingdom Rebellion in 154 BCE under the Western Han Dynasty
</p><p><b>Note: this is the current answer we have to the 'The Gallic Empire' dilemma: i.e. when should a region that seceded be treated as a foreign power? (Is the war to be coded as 'internal' or 'external'?)</b> If the original polity 1. still exists, 2. has the capabilities to reverse the revolt, and 3. makes an effort to do so (diplomatically and/or militarily) then the conflict will be considered an internal conflict rather than an external war. In the event that the revolt continues, it will become an external war when the revolting state is supported by another external power. This occurred, for example, when the Netherlands fought the Eighty Years' War (1568-1648 CE) with the Spanish Habsburgs. The internal period of the revolt can be considered over shortly after 1581, when the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands was established. In 1585 its independence was supported by the English whom by the Treaty of Nonsuch (1585) turned the United Provinces briefly into a protectorate of England. The external support could also arrive in the form of a dynastic marriage, a formal diplomatic recognition of sovereignty and military/financial assistance. Here we are not measuring ideological recognition (the intentions of the third power do not matter). We indirectly measure the power of the secessionist state. The interest of the third power tells us the rebel province is potentially capable of governing itself. The third power wouldn't be interested, and its interference would not be destablising, unless independence from the original polity was a realistic outcome.
</p><p><b>♠ rural succession ♣ ♥ </b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown. Rebellion in a rural area and/or non-administrative region aiming to secede from the centre. E.g. the revolts of rural areas in Anatolia against Ottoman control in 1629-1631 CE
</p><p><b>♠ Violent civil conflict ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/ unknown. Riots, demonstrations, and/or other form of rebellion that involves violent confrontation or suppression by authorities. E.g. the Year of the Four Emperors during the Roman Principate in 68-69 CE, when several military leaders and their armies vied with each other for power
</p><p><b>♠ Violent riots urban ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/ unknown. Riots, demonstrations, and/or other form of rebellion that involves violent confrontation or suppression by authorities in one or more urban centres. E.g. the Alexandria Riots of 205 BCE under the Ptolemaic Kingdom
</p><p><b>♠ Oppression / extermination of subaltern group ♣ ♥ </b>absent/present/inferred present/ inferred absent/uncoded/unknown. 'purges' of some community or interest group within a polity by the state, e.g. the violent persecution of religious minorities under the Sassanid Persian Empire

<p><b>♠ Wars within same ethnic group ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown Both sides come from the same ethnic group and speak the same dialect of the common language. Most civil wars will fall into this category, unless there is a significant cultural distance between the two parties.
</p><p><b>♠ Wars involving groups with different dialects  ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown Opponent groups perceive each other as having distinct ethnic identities demarcated by a significant dialectal difference, but still speaking a mutually comprehensible language but within the same linguistic group.
</p><p><b>♠ Wars involving groups with different languages  ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown The opponent groups speak mutually unintelligible languages, but similarities between languages are apparent to them. Examples include English and Dutch, or Italian and Spanish, but not English and Italian (although both are Indo-European languages, the kinship between them is not apparent to a nonspecialist).
</p><p><b>♠ Wars involving groups with different language families  ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown The opponent groups speak mutually unintelligible languages that have no similarities apparent to them. Examples include English and Chinese, or Italian and Hindu(although in the second example both are Indo-European languages, the kinship between them is not apparent to a nonspecialist). Use the consensus classifications of historical linguists (i.e. consult sources like Ethnologue or Glottolog-or even Wikipedia-if in doubt). This means that, for example, Japanese and Korean are from different language families-there are plausible hypotheses that they might be related, but there is no conclusive evidence that is accepted by the general historical linguistics community.
</p><p><b>♠ Wars between groups from different archaeological cultures ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown Use this variable for periods that are only known archaeologically. By 'different' archaeological cultures we mean those divided by a very sharp cultural gradient.
</p><p><b>♠ Wars between different religious sects ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown This refers to different religious denominations with the same world religion. E.g., Catholics vs. Protestants, or Shiites vs. Sunnis.
</p><p><b>♠ Wars between different world religions ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown E.g., Christianity vs. Islam, or Islam vs. Hinduism. World, or Axial religions include Zorastrianism, Judaism, Christianity (and its offshoots), Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Confucianism, Tengriism, Sikhism, Momrmonism, etc.
</p><p><b>♠ Wars of world religion against tribal religion ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown E.g., Christian European settlers vs. Native American Indians.
</p><p><b>♠ Wars on Urbanism-Literacy frontier ♣ ♥ </b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown Conflict between cultures with developed urbanism and literacy (indicated by written records), and cultures without developed urbanism and literacy. In this context, literacy means that the culture has a writing system (particularly, a writing system that is used to keep records). Consequently, it doesn't matter how widespread literacy is, only that some people are literate.
</p><p><b>♠ Wars on steppe frontier ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown Settled agriculturalists vs. nomadic pastoralists. Steppes are characterized by grassland plains without trees.
</p><p><b>♠ Wars on agricultural frontier ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown Settled agriculturalists vs. hunter-gatherers

<p>Consequences for polities and their populations resulting from warfare.
<br><b>♠ Annexation ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown/suspected unknown When the belligerents are sub-units of a Seshat-defined quasi-polity that has never previously been centralized this is always coded as an inter-polity war not internal warfare. So when one chiefdom annexes the territory of another chiefdom within the same archaeological tradition (evidence of destruction, occupation of territory etc.) this counts as evidence of annexation.
<br><b>♠ Looting ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown/suspected unknown The population is systematically plundered. May involve some property destruction, but there is no systematic destruction of permanent structures (see below).
<br><b>♠ Sack ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown/suspected unknown Plundering is accompanied by widespread violence. May involve some property destruction, but there is no systematic destruction of permanent structures (see below).

<br><b>♠ Deportation ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown/suspected unknown The population is expelled and moved elsewhere within the polity.
<br><b>♠ Expulsion ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown/suspected unknown The population is expelled from the territory.

<br><b>♠ Targeted massacre ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown/suspected unknown A certain segment of population is targeted for extermination. These could be the army, the elites, ethnic or religious minorities. Less than 10 percent of population is affected.
<br><b>♠ General massacre ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown/suspected unknown The estimated proportion of population killed is between 10 and 50 percent.
<br><b>♠ Extermination ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown/suspected unknown An attempt is made to eliminate the population completely. The estimated proportion of population killed/enslaved is over 50 percent.
<br><b>♠ Ethnocide ♣  ♥</b> absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown/suspected unknown A systematic program to replace the culture of the defeated with the culture of the victors.
</p><p><br>
<b>Archaeological proxies:</b> the strategy right now is to simply code as present/absent. However, in the explanatory paragraphs comment on any quantifyable features of data. For example, what proportion of skeletons bear evidence of violence. Eventually we may convert these notes into quantiative data.
</p><p><b>♠ Skeletal evidence of violence ♣  ♥</b> Code absent/present. In the explanatory paragraph indicate frequency, if known. Explain the nature of evidence (e.g., arrow points embedded in bones.
</p><p><b>♠ Mass burials ♣  ♥</b> Code absent/present. In the explanatory paragraph explain the nature of evidence (e.g., high proportion of skeletons show evidence of violent death).
</p><p><b>♠ Settlement destruction ♣  ♥</b> Code absent/present. In the explanatory paragraph explain the nature of evidence (e.g., evidence of burning, followed by abandonment).
</p><p><b>♠ Pictorial evidence of warfare ♣  ♥</b> Code absent/present. In the explanatory paragraph provide details and explain the nature of evidence (e.g., battles, attack on settlements, ritualized execution of prisoners, etc).

<p>This section lists all wars in which the polity engaged during the period described by the 'duration' variable. Each war in the list is linked to a data sheet devoted to coding the war characteristics.
</p><p>The war name format: <i>Name of war, Date war began, Belligerent A, Belligerent B</i>
</p><p>Example: <b>Russo-Japanese War, 1905, Russian Empire, Japan</b>
</p><p>Note: sieges should start with "Siege of" to show it is not a battle. Except for rare exceptions, no battle should be listed as "Battle of" write the name only as this helps alphabetical indexing of battles. The battle format applies to land and sea battles. When the literature refers to a "raid" this should be coded on the siege template if it concerns a city/urban area. If the raid is on a temporary army encampment, it should be coded as a battle.
</p><p>The war template is given in the next section of this Code Book.

<p><b>♠ Internal war name ♣  ♥</b> The name of the conflict. The 'Kitos War', 'Great Judean Revolt' and 'Bar Kokhba's Revolt' are all internal wars within the Roman Empire polity as were the Conspiracy of Lucilla, Assassination of Geta and the Persecution of Christians by Valerian.
</p><p><b>♠ Meta-conflict name ♣  ♥</b>  A name to group together similar conflicts. The 'Kitos War', 'Great Judean Revolt' and 'Bar Kokhba's Revolt' are all internal wars within the Roman Empire polity that are part of the meta-conflict 'Jewish Rebellions against Roman Rule'.

<p><b>♠ Challenger type ♣  ♥</b> (Aristocrat, Army general, Soldiers, Priest, Bureaucrat, Court, Provincial ruler, General population, Regional population, Unknown) Usually the aggressor is the challenger e.g. a rebel. However, often instability is initiated by the state - such as in purges and persecutions of sometimes apparent non-aggressors, e.g. of Christians under Roman Empire. In such cases the object of the state attack (priest and/or regional population) becomes listed as the challenger type (and is also used to code the war type - see below e.g. 'popular revolt' / 'intra-elite conflict' often both present with Christian opposition to Roman rule).
</p><p><b>♠ Highest settlement level ♣  ♥</b> (Capital, Provincial, Local) Capital - conflict occurs in the capital of the polity and those who cause it may have any association (or none at all) with the state/government/military; Provincial - those who cause instability are employed by or directly associated with state/government/military and conflict occurs entirely outside of the capital; Local - those who cause instability are not employed by or directly associated with state/government/military and this instability occurs outside of the capital.
</p><p><b>♠ Magnitude of participation ♣  ♥</b> Range estimate number people involved in conflict. It is usually possible to bracket the conflict within seven orders of magnitude (1-10, 10-100, 100-1000, 1000-10000, 10000-100000, 1000000-1000000, 1000000-10000000) from low magnitude of a conspiracy to assassinate the Caliph, to a provincial governor who marches his army on the capital, to an intractable rebellion that drags on for 30 years or a populous province that manages to gain independence.

</p><p><b>♠ Alternative names for war ♣  ♥</b> Sometimes the war is known by more than one name. If the name may sound obscure to non-specialists use this field for a simple alternative: an alternative to the "First Punic" war would be "Roman-Carthage".

<p>A collective ritual is a ritual in which two or more people participate - excluding private rituals (such as treatments and therapies) performed as a service to clients by shamans, withdoctors and other magico-medical specialists. With the official cult we refer to the set of collective ritual practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).

<p>When selecting the relevant ritual do keep in mind that we are foremost interested in rituals containing the highest intensity of dysphoria even though they may contain other elements that are less emotional or even euphoric. Furthermore, we are interested in peak levels of dysphoria for participants or ritual specialists (not the audience or sacrificial victims). Also, as we are interested in how these dysphoric moments are remembered it is necessary for the participants not normally to die during the rituals. If there are several collective rituals with the same high levels of peak dysphoria, code the best documented one.

</p><p>For the purposes of this project we define an institution as a system of social norms that governs the behavior of individuals in certain contexts, with social norms understood simply as socially transmitted rules of behavior. Institutions are also understood as being generally persistent across generations, changing only slowly over time although sometimes changing suddenly through some shock or radical social change. A classic example of an institution is marriage, which governs the behavior of the spouses in the context of their family and household. Particular norms within this institution describe the expected division of labor, rights and obligations of the partners, their children, and in-laws, etc. Because norms are socially transmitted rules, they are an example of a cultural element (by our definition, culture is any kind of socially transmitted information). There are other definitions of norms and institutions, but the one given here was chosen for its compatibility with the theoretical framework of cultural evolution (and this definition is not incompatible with alternative ones, e.g. institutions as alternative equilibria). It is often useful to distinguish formal from informal institutions. In the following, we will ask whether an institution is legally prescribed (part of a constitution or formal law code) or something that is an unwritten rule that, nevertheless, reflects the way things are done, and are expected to be done.
</p><p>We define 'elite' as the top social, political, economic, and/or religious members of society. In the codes below, when we say to code as 'equal to top nobility', we are referring to the society's elite groups and families. 'Higher than top nobility', then, refers to the ruling family, and 'lower than top nobility' refers to all people at a lower status than the elite groups and families.

<p>While the codes above reflect a legal or explicit right of some group to constrain the executive power, below code for non-formal limits. These include social or cultural norms which limit the action that can be seen as legitimately undertaken by the executive, for instance an unwritten restriction against an executive making changes to or decisions on religious matters. It is possible to code for all four combinations of absent/present along the formal/informal institution. This means that there could be the legal right to criticize a chief executive but it’s never used, or, there may not be a law that specifies how the ruler is criticized, but there is an established practice of doing so. Where coding ‘present’ provide explanation and examples. Note that you should only code non-violent actions (so a rebellion that overthrows the head of state is not an instance of informal ‘impeachment’)

<p>In this section we are interested in whether religious or supernatural agents impose limits on executive power. These codes refer to both formal, legal restrictions as well as informal constraints including social or cultural norms which limit the action that can be seen as legitimately undertaken by the executive, for instance an unwritten restriction against an executive making changes to or decisions on religious matters.

<dd> <b>♠ Constraint on executive by religious institutions ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. This refers to religious practices or norms that work to constrain the activity of the executive. This differs from the above code in that this code refers to restrictions imposed without the need for religious ‘agents’ specifically to act. For example, witchcraft accusations or the threat of such accusations could serve to limit the activity of political actors and act as a normative-behavior reinforcement.

<dd> <b>♠ Number of contested transitions ♣ ♥</b> How many transitions were contested (out of the total entered above), regardless of which party won the contest (i.e. incumbent or contesting agent). 1. We do not count as a contested transition any challenge that begins after 365 days have elapsed of the new reign. Caveat: care must be taken to record cases just after the cut off. We want to know when the conflict started. The reign end date of the previous ruler only tells us when the contest ended. Though a major event (e.g. a battle) can occur one and a half years after the new king's coronation the infighting/contest that lead up to it often begins earlier, such as immediately after the accession, or sometime within the first year. That infighting can be ignored by any historian who wants to simplify the text to mention only the battle. 2. Multiple separate contests within the transition timeframe should be counted as ONE contested transition. (Do not take time searching for the details of multiple separate contests but if all the detail is present in the same text opportunistically record it in the description field). 3. A transition can be contested before the new ruler is officially crowned.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Number of successful overturns ♣ ♥</b> How many contested transitions of power resulted in an overturn of the ruler. This includes breaks in the normal line of succession (i.e. a dynastic succession was broken, a different party or ethnic group took power, or a rebellion resulted in a change to the rules or procedures regarding powers transitions) or when a relative overturns the ruler unexpectedly within the expected line of succession. Note: There will often be 'succession crises' when there is no 'normal line of succession' so that there will be a 'contested transition' with no possibility of a successful overturn: i.e. 1. The dynasty ends with no heir (typical cause of a succession crisis); 2. The previous ruler has died and divided the kingdom between his sons (who then decide to fight for it all); 3. There is no formal succession procedure and every succession is a fight (e.g. Mamluk Sultanate). These cases should not qualify as a successful overturn as nobody is being overturned.</dd></dl>

<p>We are interested here in any systems of thought and behavior that can influence people's actions, which we term a <i>Normative Ideology</i>.  Normative ideologies are thought-systems concerned with the correct behavior of people, governments/leaders, and other groups (and particularly the relationships between these groups).
</p><p>Mainly, this will be a religious or ritual system. As usual, when we mention Religious or Ritual System our focus  is on the 'official cult', defined the same way as in the Rituals section:
With the official cult we refer to the set of collective religious practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any). However, Normative Ideologies are not restricted to religious/ritual systems. They include other thought systems, such as philosophy or anything that prescribes a particular pattern of behaviour. An example is  classical Greek philosophy, such as the works of Plato and Aristotle, who were concerned with correct or moral behaviour and whose thoughts influenced the actual practice of several societies (the empire of Alexander the Great, notably).

Examples include Classical Athens, where the official polis cult was a traditional pan-hellenic from of polytheistic worship, though many citizens followed philosophical ideals such as Socratic philosophy.

<p><b>Human sacrifice</b> (HS) is defined as deliberate and ritualized killing of an individual to please or placate supernatural beings. Common examples of supernatural beings are gods and ancestors, including a recently deceased one. In other words, sacrificing humans to follow a high-status individual in the afterlife is a legitimate example of HS. HS is distinct from capital punishment, however, even for offenses against religion (e.g., burning of heretics, punishment of vestals for transgressions). Such practices should be coded as <b>Capital Punishment for Religious Offenses</b>. Execution of 'witches' even if regularly occurring at funerals of a high-status individual is not HS. We can reflect such practices under <b>Capital Punishment for Witchcraft</b>. See Law, Robin. 1985. Human Sacrifice in Pre-Colonial West Africa. African Affairs 84 (334):53-87 for further discussion. There are several distinct categories of HS listed below. First code any special kinds of HS that are present in the (quasi)polity. Then code the general code (<b>Human sacrifice </b>) based on the codes for special kinds of HS. Note that HS is also coded under Rituals; here, however, we address general features of HS not tied to any particular ritual.
</p><p><b>♠ Human sacrifice ♣ ♥</b> 0-5/Unknown    To code this HS scale first code special kinds listed below. Then use the explanation below to assign a numerical code. Indicate uncertainty and disagreement in the usual way.5: HS of high-status or relative is present (or both) 4: HS of low-status, but not high status/relative 3: HS of out-group only 2: HS is condemned by an influential figure 1: HS is not practiced 0: Official cult forbids HS (the official cult is defined in the Rituals section)

<p><b>Supernatural Enforcement of Morality</b>
For this section, include any type of supernatural punishment or reward either in this lifetime (e.g., curses, good fortune) or in the afterlife (e.g., hell, reincarnation). This includes generalized impersonal punishment/reward (e.g., karma, mana) as well as punishment by specific supernatural beings. Include specific details of the nature and extent of punishment/reward in the description. Code “compound” moral actions (e.g., filial piety = kin + respect) in multiple categories as necessary. Morality categories are based on Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt &amp; Graham, 2007) and Morality-As-Cooperation theory (Curry, 2016). In general, we are contrasting enforcement of “moral”/”prosocial” behaviours directed between humans with that of “amoral”/“procedural” behaviours directed by humans towards supernatural beings (e.g., prayers, rituals, sacrifices, taboos).

Moralizing religion is described as ‘primary’ when the principal moral concerns of supernatural agents or forces pertain to cooperation in human affairs.

<dd class="ps-5"><b>♠ Moralizing enforcement is certain ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. This variable reflects the predictability of supernatural punishment for transgression or reward for ethical behavior. A code of absence here could result from a variety of characteristics of supernatural agents: if they are fickle or capricious, if they can be bought off or tricked, or, alternatively, if they are not independently concerned about human morality and need to be persuaded or induced to punish transgressions.</dd>
<dd class="ps-5"><b>♠ Moralizing norms are broad ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. This reflects how many aspects of morality deities care about and enforce. It is coded as absent when moralizing supernatural punishment/reward pertains to only very narrowly circumscribed domains, for example, kin-based moral precepts punishing incest or rewarding hospitality rather than enforcing moral norms across a broad range of social situations.</dd>

<dd class="ps-5"><b>♠ Moralizing religion adopted by commoners ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. This reflects the extent to which beliefs in a moralizing religion are adopted by the masses. A typical situation in which this variable is coded absent is when the state religion professed by rulers and elites, and endorsing beliefs in supernatural punishments and rewards, is different from the popular religion which lacks or professes only much weaker beliefs in supernatural enforcement. On the other hand, this variable might be coded as present, even while the Elites variable is coded absent, for example when popular religion emphasizes supernatural enforcement, but the religion of rulers and elites does not.</dd>

For example, different weeds or pest species like different crops, so rotation can minimize their harmful effects. Provide details about the sequence of crop rotation (i.e. the crops involved and their timings). Make note if nitrogen fixing or nutrient return (or other reasons for crop rotation) is mentioned.

<p><i>Estimate the importance to the diet of the following subsistence features on a scale of 0 – 10 (0=not practiced, 10=other subsistence strategies not practiced)</i>
Don’t worry about trying to be precise. We are looking for your best estimates. It may be easier to complete this by making comparisons with previous or later time periods
Note 1: Agriculture + Animal Husbandry + Wild Foods + Trade should add up to 10, e.g. Agriculture 6 + Animal Husbandry 3 + Wild Foods 1 + Trade 0 = 10
Note 2: these estimates pertain to the commoner population, not the elites.

</p>
<ul><li>Foraging/hunting (terrestrial)</li>
<li>Fishing and other wild aquatic foods</li>
<li>Pastoralism (domestic animals provide main form of subsistence)</li>
<li>Agro-pastoralism (Combination of pastoral activities and crop production in an interdependent manner)</li>
<li>Horticulture (small scale gardens, usually near settlement)</li>
<li>Swidden (slash-and-burn/shifting) agriculture</li>
<li>Permanent agriculture (large areas of land (fields) whose primary function is related to agriculture – fields can be left fallow for a period but are eventually used for growing crops again)</li>
<li>Intensive permanent agriculture (as permanent agriculture but with practices or labour inputs that lead to substantially reduced fallow or otherwise increased yields)</li>
<li>Other (please specify)</li>
<li>Two or more types equally dominant (please specify)</li></ul>
